# SQL-Projects

### What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD - my favorite part in the whole explanation) data stored in tables within a database.

### And coming to MySQL-

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL to manage data. It is an open-source software that allows you to store and manipulate data in a structured, tabular form. MySQL is one of the most popular databases used for web applications and data management.

## Project Summaries

### 1. Amazon Sales Analysis

Analyzed an Amazon sales report to uncover business insights. After cleaning the data by dropping 11 columns, SQL queries revealed the business is overwhelmingly **B2C-focused** and that the **'Set' product category generates the most revenue**, despite having fewer orders than 'kurta'.

### 2. Best Netflix Content
Identified the top 10 highest-rated titles from a large Netflix dataset. A single SQL query was used to filter titles with an IMDb score of 8.1+, rank them, and limit the output, efficiently creating a clean list of critically acclaimed content.

### 3. GATE 2019 Applicant Trends

Determined the most popular engineering disciplines from GATE applicant data. By cleaning the dataset and using SQL to filter for the year 2019 and rank by applicant count, the analysis identified **Mechanical, Civil, and Computer Science** as the top fields.
