What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD - my favorite part in the whole explanation) data stored in tables within a database.

And coming to MySQL-

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL to manage data. It is an open-source software that allows you to store and manipulate data in a structured, tabular form. MySQL is one of the most popular databases used for web applications and data management.
